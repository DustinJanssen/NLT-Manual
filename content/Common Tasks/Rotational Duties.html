<h1>Rotational Duties</h1>

<p>As an NLT, there are two rotational duties you may be asked to perform. These duties are important for maintaining cleanliness and ensuring smooth operations during lunchtime.</p>

<h2>Cleaning the Staff Bathroom</h2>

<p>You may be asked to clean the staff bathroom on a rotational basis. If you are assigned this task, ask one of the teachers to show you the proper procedure for cleaning and the supplies you will need to use. It is essential to maintain a clean and sanitary environment in the staff bathroom for the well-being of all faculty members.</p>

<h2>Soup Duty</h2>

<p>Soup duty is a simple yet essential task during lunchtime. When you are on soup duty, head to the cafeteria before lunch starts and put on gloves. Your role will be to hand the bowls of soup to the students as they come through the lunch line. This duty helps ensure an orderly and efficient lunch service, allowing students to have a pleasant dining experience.</p>

<p>Make sure to perform these duties diligently and responsibly, as they contribute to the overall functioning of the school and the well-being of the students and staff.</p>
