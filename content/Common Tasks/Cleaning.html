<h1>Cleaning</h1>

<p>Cleaning is an essential part of the daily routine at Lilyvale Elementary School. It takes place after lunch and before the fifth period, from 13:10 to 13:25. As an NLT, your role is to guide and oversee the students while they clean the area you are assigned to.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Groups</h2>

<p>Students are divided into two cleaning groups: A.C.E. and B.D.F. These groups will rotate between cleaning their classroom and another designated location. The rotation generally occurs every fortnight.</p>

<h2>Big Clean</h2>

<p>Occasionally, the school will conduct a "big clean" where cleaning time and the fifth period are combined. Non-classroom cleaning will take place from 13:45 until the end of the fifth period. During these big cleans, your role remains the same: guide and oversee the students as they clean the assigned areas.</p>

<p>Remember, cleaning is an opportunity to teach responsibility and teamwork to the students, so make sure to support and encourage them throughout the process.</p>
