<h1>Materials Preparation</h1>

<p>Before you begin any printing or cutting tasks, it&#39;s essential to confirm all the details of the job, such as paper type, size, color, double-sided or single-sided printing, stapling, and hole punching. If you&#39;re using color paper, double-check that you&#39;ve selected the correct colors before printing. If you&#39;re creating the materials yourself, prepare a single copy and have Ms. Aoki review it before continuing.</p>

<h2>Printers/Copiers</h2>

<p>There are several printers and copiers available for your use. Here&#39;s a quick guide to help you choose the appropriate one for your needs:</p>

<h3>Staff Room</h3>

<ul>
	<li>LBP841C: This printer is located near the front door. It is the most cost-effective color printer, so use it if you need color for non-student work. It should also be used as the default for all staff-related work.</li>
	<li>iR-ADV C5250: This printer is located at the back of the staff room. Avoid using it if you need more than 25-30 copies. It has a larger feed tray, making it suitable for printing on large, thick paper from your computer. However, it may not always feed the paper properly, so you may need to apply slight pressure on the top edge to help it feed.</li>
	<li>iPF605L Plus: This is the large-format printer and is rarely used. You might use it to print items like the big map in the English room. It will most likely only be used to replace that map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Copy Room</h3>

<p>The copy machine in the copy room should be your default go-to for most tasks. However, use the staff room copier if you need fewer than 25 copies. This machine can only do grayscale copying and requires manual duplexing.</p>

<p>To use the copier, place the paper you want to copy on the copy bed. Fill the feed and ensure the number of copies is set to 0. Press the &#39;create master&#39; button. Check that the master is okay, then enter the desired number of copies and press the &#39;copy&#39; button.</p>

<p>This machine is old and finicky, so you may need to adjust the ink level and speed to achieve the desired results. Always exercise caution and patience when using the copiers to ensure the best possible outcome for your materials.</p>
