<h1 class="text-center">Lesson Preparation</h1>
<hr>

<audio controls src=""></audio>

<p>Preparing for your daily lessons primarily involves having the necessary tools and understanding of your class structure. Ensure to carry writing utensils, including at least a red and a blue marking pen. It's advisable to also bring a black pen, pencil, and eraser for versatility in marking and note-taking. Having a name list on hand can be beneficial, and is required on certain days like the class speech contest.</p>

<h2>Split Classes</h2>
<p>For split classes, your role will extend to designing lesson plans. The "We Can!" program you've used with other grade levels will be a valuable reference for this task. Despite Ms. Aoki creating two distinct levels for the grammar class, you are not obligated to do the same unless you're confident about it.</p>

<p>If you opt to use digital resources for teaching, bear in mind that OK House only has TVs for monitors. I personally leveraged my Mac and iPad to supplement the lack of a SMART board. Alternatively, you could make use of the English Department's tablet. While it does feature a touch screen, its performance can be sluggish, comparable to molasses on a cold winter morning. Therefore, patience might be required while operating it.</p>
