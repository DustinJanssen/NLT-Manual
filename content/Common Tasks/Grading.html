<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>Grading student work is an essential part of your role as an NLT. It is important to follow the school's grading guidelines to ensure consistency and fairness. Here are some general guidelines for grading:</p>

<h2>Marking answers</h2>

<p>All answers should be marked using red ink. For this, it is recommended to use refillable red felt pens, as the school provides the refill cartridges. Use a slash or an x mark for incorrect answers and a circle, swirl, or hanamaru for correct answers. Hanamaru are typically used when all questions are correct, but you may use them for a section if all questions in that section are correct.</p>

<p>If a student achieves a perfect score, they are generally given a sticker or a stamp as a reward. Consult with T1 to determine the appropriate reward.</p>

<p>If a student provides an incorrect answer, they should either erase and rewrite it with a black pencil or write the corrected answer with a blue pencil. Circle the corrected answer in blue ink. It's also recommended to use refillable blue felt pens for this task. Once all corrections have been made, mark the paper "OK" near the score.</p>

<h2>Workbooks and worksheets</h2>

<p>The grading process for workbooks and worksheets may vary depending on T1's preferences. Be sure to ask T1 for their specific guidelines when it comes to grading these materials.</p>

<p>It is crucial to maintain consistency and accuracy while grading to provide constructive feedback to the students and track their progress effectively. Always consult with T1 if you have any questions or concerns about the grading process.</p>
