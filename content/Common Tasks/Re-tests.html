<h1>Re-tests (再テスト)</h1>

<p>Re-tests, or 再テスト in Japanese, are additional mandatory opportunities for students to retake an exam they have previously taken but did not perform well on. The purpose of re-tests is to encourage students to learn from their mistakes, reinforce their knowledge, and demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter. At Lilyvale Elementary, re-tests are allowed up to a maximum of three times.</p>

<h2>Threshold for Re-tests</h2>

<p>The threshold for requiring a re-test is generally set at a score below 80%. This means that students who score below 80% on their initial test will be required to take a re-test.</p>

<h2>Re-test Format</h2>

<p>The re-test will have the same questions as the original test but with the answers or questions scrambled. This is to ensure that the students are still being tested on the same material while minimizing the chances of memorizing the exact order of questions or answers.</p>

<h2>Preparation for Re-tests</h2>

<p>Since students are usually not eager to study for re-tests, it is important to allocate 2-3 minutes before administering the test to help them quickly review and practice the material. This will refresh their memory and potentially improve their performance on the re-test.</p>

<h2>Re-test Schedule</h2>

<p>For grades 4 and below, re-tests will always take place during class time. For grades 5 and 6, the second re-test will be conducted during class, while the third re-test must be taken outside of class hours. This encourages older students to take responsibility for their learning and make the most of their re-test opportunities.</p>

<p>Make sure to write the number (2nd or 3rd) near the score when you grade it.</p>
