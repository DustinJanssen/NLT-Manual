<p>Incorporating technology into the classroom enhances the learning experience for students, allowing for interactive, engaging, and dynamic lessons. At our school, each classroom is equipped with the following tech devices:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Computer:</strong> Each classroom has a computer to aid in teaching and presentation of digital learning materials.</li>
	<li><strong>Projector:</strong> The projector is used for displaying content from the computer, including presentations, videos, interactive exercises, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>SMART Boards:</strong> Each classroom has a SMART Board, a touch-sensitive display that connects to the computer and the projector. However, it's important to note that these boards don't always function as expected. Some have touch function but no pen, while others might not have either. Additionally, these are older models and lack multi-touch capability. They do not have built-in screens and thus rely on a projector to display content. Due to this, you will need to align the SMART Board with the projector. It's best to do this during the five-minute break between classes to avoid eating into teaching time.</li>
	<li><strong>Tablet Laptops (for Grade 4 and above):</strong> Starting from Grade 4, each student is provided with a tablet laptop. It's crucial to understand that these are individual devices, not connected workstations, meaning there's no way to control all devices from a master unit. The tablets have a relatively slow response time and their battery life leaves much to be desired. Additionally, as you will soon discover, students can be quite hard on these devices. These devices are generally not used in English class. The exception is the sixth grade using them to create PowerPoints for their speeches.</li>
</ul>

<p>While technology can greatly enhance the learning experience, it's important to understand its limitations and to be prepared for any technical issues that may arise. Always have a backup plan in case the technology fails. Incorporating a blend of tech-based and traditional teaching methods can help ensure that the learning process remains uninterrupted.</p>
