<p>The primary materials used for English classes at our school are McGraw Hill's "We Can!" series textbooks and workbooks. These comprehensive resources are divided into specific grade levels as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Grade 1 (G1):</strong> Uses We Can! 1.</li>
	<li><strong>Grade 2 (G2):</strong> Uses We Can! 2.</li>
	<li><strong>Grade 3 (G3):</strong> Covers the first half of We Can! 3.</li>
	<li><strong>Grade 4 (G4):</strong> Covers the second half of We Can! 3 and part of We Can! 4.</li>
	<li><strong>Grade 5 (G5) & Grade 6 (G6):</strong> These grades have a grammar section using a different book. They cover as much of the remaining sections of We Can! 4 as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The We Can! series is designed with progressive learning in mind. Here's a brief overview of what each level entails:</p>

<h2>We Can! 1 & 2</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Topics:</strong> My Friends, My Family, Happy Birthday!, Animals, Seven Days, Feelings, Beautiful Nature, My Things, and more (16 in total).</li>
	<li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Two to four-line dialogs, songs, and chants (23 in total), phonics covering consonants, vowels, and three-letter words.</li>
	<li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> 642 words.</li>
	<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Writing three-letter words.</li>
	<li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Adjectives, prepositions, -ing forms, future, be, have, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Interactions:</strong> Fun Time.</li>
	<li><strong>Classroom Use:</strong> Games and activities (32 in total), acting out, playing games.</li>
</ul>

<h2>We Can! 3 & 4</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Topics:</strong> Camp, Sports, Chores, Jobs, My School is Cool!, Fun on the Weekend, Math in English, My Dream Vacation, and more (16 in total).</li>
	<li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Six to eight-line dialogs and small talks, songs and chants (30 in total), phonics covering silent e, two-in-one consonants and vowels, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Vocabulary:</strong> 200+165=365 new words.</li>
	<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Copying chants and sentences.</li>
	<li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Comparison, superlatives, present and past tenses, and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Interactions:</strong> Challenge Time.</li>
	<li><strong>Classroom Use:</strong> Games and activities (32 in total), quizzes, and BINGO (every unit has a bingo page, but we don't use it very often).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each book contains a blend of topics, songs and chants, writing activities, and grammar lessons. Each unit follows a similar pattern: introduction/dialogue, grammar, chant, and phonics. We typically start with the chant or phonics, then the introduction, and the grammar last. Workbook pages for those sections are usually assigned after practicing in two to three classes. We move through the material at a measured pace to ensure comprehension. While repeating the same two pages for several classes might seem redundant, our students seem to benefit from this approach.</p>

<h2>Other Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the "We Can!" series, the grammar section utilizes a separate book designed for middle school English. The grammar part of the lesson is conducted in Japanese, and you are forbidden from using Japanese. </p>

<p>For Eiken preparation and additional resources, materials are available online and in the small department library. I'll leave what I have found in my shared folder. In case it gets deleted, feel free to email me to get them again. It's important to familiarize yourself with these supplementary materials as they can enhance your lessons and provide additional support for the students.</p>
