<p>Creating fruitful interactions with students and parents is integral to your role. Here are a few essential principles to follow:</p>

<h2>Interacting with Students</h2>

<p>Your main responsibility is to engage students in English conversation as much as possible. Seize every opportunity to talk with them, whether it's on the bus, between classes, or during breaks. Younger students are especially fond of roleplay, which can make the learning experience fun and interactive.</p>

<p>The golden rule: don't be reckless. Maintain professionalism at all times, both on and off-campus. Use only English when conversing with students. Using Japanese will result in criticism from Ms. Aoki and a lengthy lecture. </p>

<p>Should you cross paths with students outside of school, make sure to greet them. This not only strengthens rapport but also enhances classroom interactions. Bear in mind, in Japan, teachers are considered on duty at all times, unlike in many Western countries. Therefore, your actions and behavior, even during personal time, reflect on your role and the school.</p>

<h2>Interacting with Parents</h2>

<p>Just as with students, greeting parents off-campus can foster positive relationships. Upholding high standards of professionalism in all your interactions with parents is essential.</p>

<p>Do not accept gifts from parents under any circumstances. Despite gift-giving being prevalent in some cultures, it is against school policy.</p>

<p>Establishing trust and maintaining open communication lines with students and their parents will greatly enrich the learning environment and contribute to the success of your role.</p>
