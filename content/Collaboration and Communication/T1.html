<p>Coordinating with the Japanese teachers may vary since each of them has unique expectations. Ms. Aoki, the department head and the sole full-time teacher, may demand a higher level of responsibility from you. Thus, maintaining proper conduct is essential when working with her. On the other hand, the other English teachers are part-time teachers. They are more like peers, leading to a relatively more amicable relationship.</p>

<p>The 'T1' refers to the primary teacher of the class, and as such, they will take the lead in conducting the lessons. However, your role in maintaining class order is vital. While teaching tasks may switch between you and T1, you must be proactive, aiding in managing the classroom. When not leading the lesson, patrol the classroom to ensure that students are attentive and focused.</p>

<p>Outside classroom hours, lend a hand with administrative tasks like printing or grading. As the part-time teachers are restricted from working beyond their designated hours, any assistance you provide can help them conclude their work promptly and head home on time. Keep this fact in mind as you plan your work schedule.</p>
