<audio controls src=""></audio>

<p>Building strong, collaborative relationships with the administrative and staff members is crucial in your role at Lilyvale Primary School.</p>

<h2>Interacting with Administration</h2>
<p>The school administration, comprising the Director/Principal, Vice-Director, Vice-Principal, Teacher Manager, and Outside Relations Manager, oversees the daily operations and long-term strategies of the school.</p>
<p>Maintaining professionalism and respect when interacting with the administration is paramount. While regular interaction may not be required, extending greetings is important. Make it a point to greet them proactively, ideally before they greet you.</p>

<h2>Interacting with Staff</h2>
<p>The staff at Lilyvale Primary School encompasses various roles, such as the Ground's Manager/Bus Manager, Secretaries, Bus Drivers, Homeroom Teachers, Non-Homeroom Teachers, Assistant Teachers, and After-School Staff.</p>
<p>Working harmoniously with all staff members fosters a positive and supportive learning environment. Inside the staff room, and only inside the staff room, using Japanese is allowed and can lead to smoother communication, as most staff members have a basic understanding of English.</p>
<p>Approach all staff interactions with respect and understanding, recognizing the essential roles each member plays in the school's operation. Be proactive in offering assistance and don't hesitate to request help when necessary. Regular communication is key to building strong relationships and fostering a cooperative work environment.</p>
<p>Remember, the school operates as a team with every member, regardless of their role, making significant contributions to its success. Building positive relationships with administration and staff will greatly enhance your teaching experience.</p>
