# Lilyvale Culture Notes
This section aims to provide you with valuable insights into the unique cultural aspects of our school and some practical advice for navigating your role. As you begin your journey, it is essential to be aware of certain nuances.

Lilyvale Primary School is a privately-owned institution founded by Mr. Mike, who has a strong interest in education and a passion for anything English. Despite his background and expertise, the school operates as a Japanese business. Therefore, it is important to understand and respect the cultural norms that are prevalent here.

The following should be taken into consideration to ensure a smooth experience.

## Clear and Effective Communication
English is a second language for the faculty and staff here. While most everyone has a basic grasp of the language, outside of Mr. Mike, Mr. Kensuke, and the members of the English team, it is recommended that you speak in a fairly similar manner as you do to the students.

That said, the above exceptions do not have a native grasp of the language. Avoid the use of jargon or complex vocabulary. Additionally, be mindful that certain numerical expressions may be interpreted differently by Ms. Aoki. For instance, "many students" or "several students" might refer to a smaller number of students than you might expect. Understanding this will help you better communicate with her and adapt your approach when discussing student performance. “Double check” does not mean checking twice, rather you better be 100% sure that are zero errors before having her check. While your co-workers in the English department will be busy as well, it is advised to have them check at least one time before handing something off to Ms. Aoki.

## Time Management and Planning
At Lilyvale, the dedication to providing an excellent education for the students occasionally results in longer-than-anticipated events and meetings. When submitting requests or planning activities, be prepared for the possibility that the school may underestimate the time required for tasks. Flexibility and adaptability will be crucial assets in these situations.

## Your Professional Journey
As an NLT, Lilyvale presents you with a dynamic and challenging work environment. Embrace this opportunity to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on your students' lives. However, it is essential to be mindful of your professional goals and aspirations. While the Japanese job market often values long-term commitments to employers, it is crucial to strike a balance between loyalty and personal growth. Make the most of your time at Lilyvale, and remember that your well-being is equally important.

## Seeking Advice and Support
Do not hesitate to reach out to your colleagues, both in the English department and in other areas of the school, for advice or assistance. Building strong relationships with your coworkers can enhance your experience at Lilyvale and create a network of support throughout your time here.

It is important to be aware of the chain of command when seeking advice or assistance. For teaching matters, you should first consult the native teacher you are working with for that grade, followed by Ms. Aoki (or the current head English teacher). Beyond that point, it is advisable not to escalate the issue further. For other matters, consult John or the current NLT Manager. Please remember, under no circumstances should you go directly to Mr. Kensuke (or the current principal) or, even worse, straight to Mr. Mike. Respecting the chain of command is crucial for maintaining a harmonious and efficient work environment.

## Conclusion
In summary, understanding the unique cultural aspects of Lilyvale, effective communication, time management, and seeking advice through the appropriate channels will help you navigate your role successfully.
