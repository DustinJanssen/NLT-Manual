# Job Description
As the Native Language Teacher (NLT) at Lilyvale Primary School, your main responsibility will be co-teaching with a Japanese faculty member. This will involve engaging the class directly through activities such as call and repeat, or monitoring the class while the T1 teacher is teaching. Outside the classroom, your responsibilities include monitoring students, cleaning (most likely the English room), printing and cutting materials, grading assignments, proofreading student work, and possibly transcribing or translating materials.

For the most part, lesson planning will be handled by the T1 teacher. The exception is a split class. Ms. Aoki prefers splitting Grade 6 into two groups and having them alternate between grammar and conversation. In that case, you will be responsible for planning the lesson.

Additionally, you are expected to adhere to professional standards of conduct, including punctuality, attendance, and appropriate dress. Remember, this is a business first, then a school. Your work hours for the timesheet are 7:45-16:45 Monday to Friday and 7:45-13:15 on Saturdays. You are expected to be present for all scheduled classes (including Saturdays) and meetings. Please refer to your contract for more detailed information on your specific responsibilities and expectations.

Be aware that there may not be a bus available on certain days, so you will need to arrange your own transportation to campus. The distance from Akatsuka Station to Lilyvale is approximately 12 km, and the public bus service is infrequent. Therefore, obtaining a bicycle, ideally one with gears for steep hills, is advisable. It's important to note that you may not have sufficient paid leave to cover all days without a bus. However, the principal or an administrator may be able to provide transportation.

I strongly recommend taking those days off if possible. To facilitate this, if you work on Saturdays or Sundays, you will be granted a leave day. Even if Saturday is a half-day, you will still receive a full-day leave. Please take advantage of this opportunity.
