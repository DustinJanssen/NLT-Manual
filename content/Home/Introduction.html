<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to Japan and to Lilyvale Primary School! This manual is designed to provide you with information and resources to help you succeed as the new native language teacher (NLT) at Lilyvale. In this manual, you will find information about the school, events, duties, assessments, and more.</p>

<p>Teaching in a foreign country can be both challenging and rewarding, requiring a high level of cultural awareness and sensitivity. It's important to respect local customs and traditions while remaining open-minded and adaptable. As you settle into your new role, don't hesitate to reach out to other teachers and staff members for support and guidance.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this manual serves as a starting point, and you'll need to adapt to your specific situation. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me at dustin.ewa1@gmail.com. Good luck, and enjoy your time at Lilyvale Primary School!</p>
