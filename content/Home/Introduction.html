<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to Japan and to Lilyvale Primary School! This manual is designed to provide you with information and resources to help you succeed as the new native language teacher (NLT) at Lilyvale. In this manual, you will find information about the school, events, duties, assessments, and more.</p>

<p>Teaching in a foreign country can be both challenging and rewarding, requiring a high level of cultural awareness and sensitivity. It&#39;s important to respect local customs and traditions while remaining open-minded and adaptable.
