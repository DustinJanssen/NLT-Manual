<h1>Sports' Day / Marathon</h1>

<p>Sports' Day, or Undokai, and Marathon are two key athletic events in the Lilyvale school calendar. Undokai takes place before summer break, while the Marathon is held in November. Both events showcase the students' physical abilities and promote teamwork and sportsmanship.</p>

<p>As an NLT, your role during these events is primarily to support and observe the students. The dress code for both events consists of track pants, the Lilyvale polo shirt, and the Lilyvale ball cap. Each year, you will be assigned to a different house to sit with and cheer on during the competitions.</p>

<p>For the Marathon, you may also be asked to film the finish line to help determine the winners in case of close finishes or ties. By participating in these events, you contribute to a positive atmosphere and encourage the students to perform their best while enjoying the spirit of competition.</p>
