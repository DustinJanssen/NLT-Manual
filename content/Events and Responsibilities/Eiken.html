<h1>Eiken (English Proficiency Test)</h1>

<p>Lilyvale Primary School places a strong emphasis on Eiken Test preparation for its students. The Eiken Test is an English proficiency exam, and students start taking the Eiken Jr. levels in the first grade. As students progress through the grades, they will take more advanced Eiken tests.</p>

<h2>Eiken Jr. Bronze, Silver, and Gold (1st to 3rd Grade)</h2>

<p>First-grade students take the Eiken Jr. Bronze test, second-grade students take Eiken Jr. Silver, and third-grade students take Eiken Jr. Gold. These classes are taught together with the T1 teacher, similar to regular classes.</p>

<h2>Eiken Jr. Gold and Eiken Grade 5 and Up (4th Grade)</h2>

<p>In fourth grade, students are split between Eiken Jr. Gold and Eiken Grade 5 and up. You will be responsible for guiding the higher-level students through self-study. Although it is called self-study, fourth-graders may need more support, so treat it more like a tutorial (teacher-guided self-study for the non-Brits).</p>

<h2>Eiken Grade 5 and Up (5th Grade)</h2>

<p>Fifth-grade students primarily focus on Eiken Grade 5, but you will be in charge of students taking Grade 4 and up. As with the fourth-grade students, your role is to oversee their self-study and ensure they are genuinely studying.</p>

<h2>Eiken Grade 5, 4, and Higher Levels (6th Grade)</h2>

<p>Sixth-grade students are divided into three groups: those retaking the Grade 5 test, those taking the Eiken Grade 4 test, and those taking higher-level tests. Once again, your responsibility is to supervise their self-study. However, for students taking Eiken Grade 3 and up, which includes a writing portion, Ms. Aoki will emphasize the importance of practicing this skill and may request that you provide more structured lessons before the start of self-study.</p>

<p>A resource book for Grade 3 writing has been prepared, and while it may not be perfect, feel free to use it as a starting point for your lessons. This book can help guide students through the writing portion of the Eiken test and support their overall preparation.</p>
