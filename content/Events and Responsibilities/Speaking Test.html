<h1>Speaking Test</h1>

<p>The Speaking Test can be a challenging aspect of your role as an NLT at Lilyvale. In this test, you will have approximately three minutes to ask each student a series of questions individually. The specific format and questions will vary depending on the grade level, with most questions taken from the textbook. The exception is the sixth grade, which follows a format similar to the interview portion of the Eiken Test (refer to the homework sheet <a href="">link here</a> for instructions on conducting this).</p>

<p>You will be required to record the audio of each student&#39;s test and upload it to the file server. In terms of grading, Aoki-sensei has not provided a specific rubric, so you should use your best judgment when evaluating the students&#39; performances. Keep in mind that the threshold for passing is quite low. If a student does not respond after you have repeated the question, assign a zero and move on to the next student.</p>

<p>By conducting and grading these speaking tests, you play a vital role in assessing the students&#39; progress in their English language skills, helping to identify areas for improvement and ensuring their continued growth.</p>
