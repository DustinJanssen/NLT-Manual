<p>The Chorus Festival is an off-campus event that showcases the musical talents of the students. As an NLT, your role is primarily focused on logistical support and supervision.</p>

<p>Before the festival begins, you will assist with the set-up of the venue. After the event concludes, you will help with the clean-up. During the festival itself, you will sit with and watch the students, ensuring their safety and well-being.</p>

<p>You may be asked to help with other tasks, such as opening and closing doors or assisting students as they navigate stairs. Your participation in the Chorus Festival is essential to ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for the students, staff, and audience members. Embrace this opportunity to support the school community and celebrate the artistic achievements of your students.</p>
