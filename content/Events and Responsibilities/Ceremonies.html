<p>As part of our school's culture, four important ceremonies punctuate the academic year: the entrance ceremony, the mid-term ceremony, the graduation ceremony, and the dinner/closing ceremony. Each ceremony has its own unique importance and format. Here's what you can expect from each:</p>

<h2>Entrance Ceremony</h2>

<p>The entrance ceremony marks the beginning of the academic year and welcomes new students to our school. It is typically held inside Victoria Hall and spans several periods. As a member of the faculty, you will be seated in a designated section for the duration of the event. The ceremony is mostly passive from your perspective, except for the Welcome Performance. During this portion, you might be asked to perform a simple gesture or say a phrase like "Welcome" in time with the music.</p>

<h2>Mid-Term Ceremony</h2>

<p>The mid-term ceremony is akin to a regular morning assembly, except you won't be required to make the morning announcement. Your role in this ceremony is to simply stand at the back and observe the proceedings.</p>

<h2>Graduation Ceremony</h2>

<p>The graduation ceremony is a solemn and joyous event marking the completion of our students' journey in our school. Similar to the entrance ceremony, this event takes place inside Victoria Hall over multiple periods. You will be seated in the faculty section throughout the ceremony. Your role here is primarily passive, observing and applauding our students' achievements as they prepare to move on to the next phase of their education.</p>

<h2>Dinner/Closing Ceremony</h2>

<p>This unique ceremony is held off-campus at a local hotel and marks the end of the academic year. The dinner component of the event is a special opportunity for students to learn about Western dining etiquette. The dinner adopts British-style knife and fork handling. If you are unfamiliar with this dining style, do not worry. The hotel staff will give a demonstration, and you can learn along with the students.</p>

<p>Remember, these ceremonies are more than just formalities; they are important moments in our students' academic journeys. Your attendance and participation signify your support and commitment to their education. Enjoy these occasions, and take pride in the progress and achievements of our students.</p>
