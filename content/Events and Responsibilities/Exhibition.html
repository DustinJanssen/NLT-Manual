<h1>Exhibition</h1>

<p>Exhibition is the largest event in the second half of the school year at Lilyvale Primary School. It showcases the students' work from throughout the year and takes place on a Saturday. The workday runs from 07:45 to approximately 19:00 (7:00 pm), with a Teacher Appreciation event held by the sixth graders afterward.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although you can take the bus to work on this day, you will need to make your own way back home if you attend the Teacher Appreciation event. We recommend biking to work, allowing you to bike home afterward. There are to bus stops the on in front of the school and on about a twelve minute walk behind the school.</p>

<p>The English section of the event consists of the students saying the same speeches as contest, tanabata they wrote, and a few pictures from class. As such, most of the work for the Exhibition will already have been done far in advance.</p>

<p>Your responsibilities will include: consolidating all English-related materials for display and setting up the materials on the designated table.</p>

<p>During the event, you are free to walk around and explore the other exhibits or work on grading or other tasks that need to be completed. Make sure to attend the Teacher Appreciation event, as it is a significant part of the school's tradition.</p>
