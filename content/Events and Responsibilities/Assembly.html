<h1>Assembly and Morning Announcement</h1>

<p>At Lilyvale, there are two types of Chokai: grade assembly and regular assembly. They usually alternate between each other.</p>

<p><strong>Grade Assembly</strong>: This assembly is held in the classroom, and as an NLT, you will not be required to participate. Treat it like a non-assembly morning.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Assembly</strong>: This assembly is typically held inside the gym. If you are making the morning announcement, you should wear the uniform. Morning announcement duty alternates between you and the other NLT. The broadcast committee will introduce you by saying, "Morning Announcement, [name]." You will bow to the Mr. Kensuke or Mr. Mike (the important person) near the stage stairs, climb up the stairs onto the stage, and bow to the Japanese flag. At the microphone, bow to the students and perform the usual greeting: "Good Morning, everyone. How are you?" After their response, list the events of the week in simple English. Finish by bowing to the students again and walking off the stage.</p>

<p><strong>Birthday Assembly</strong>: Once a month, the regular assembly becomes a birthday assembly. During your birth month, you will join in the celebration. Simply say your name, what you would like to do this year, and express your gratitude for them celebrating with you. Sharing your age is optional.</p>
