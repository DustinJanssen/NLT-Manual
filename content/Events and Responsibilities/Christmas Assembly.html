<h1 class="text-center">Christmas Assembly</h1>
<hr>

<audio controls src=""></audio>

<p>The Christmas Assembly is a significant event in the Lilyvale calendar, serving as the main event of the first half of the school year (with the Exhibition being the main event for the second half, discussed in the next chapter).</p>

<p>This festive occasion takes place on the Saturday afternoon (Green House) and all day Sunday (Red and Ivory House) before winter break. Students begin practicing for their plays as early as April. Each play features a collaboration between two grades, resulting in three plays for each house. However, the same set of plays will be performed for all three houses, which means you'll have the opportunity to watch the same play three times.</p>

<p>As an NLT, your role in the Christmas Assembly begins during the main event. You will most likely be assigned to a reception duty before the plays start, such as guarding a door and ensuring that parents use the main entrance. During the plays, you will be responsible for sitting with and supervising the students, helping to maintain a safe and organized environment.</p>

<p>By participating in the Christmas Assembly, you contribute to the success of this memorable event and support the hard work and dedication of the students and staff.</p>
