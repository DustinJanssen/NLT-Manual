<p>Open School events are held on Saturdays with the aim of recruiting new students to Lilyvale. Your participation and responsibilities during these events may vary.</p>

<p>On the Friday before Open School, you may be asked to assist with preparations, such as setting up signs for the toilets. Consult with Fujinami-sensei to determine which signs should be used.</p>

<p>During the Open School event itself, if you do not have classes scheduled, you will likely be asked to help care for younger children while their parents attend a lecture. This typically takes place in the study room during 3rd and 4th periods. Your role will be to play and interact with the children, ensuring they have a positive experience while their parents learn more about the school.</p>

<p>By engaging in these Open School events, you contribute to showcasing the welcoming and nurturing environment that Lilyvale has to offer prospective families.</p>
