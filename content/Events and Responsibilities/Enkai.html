<h1>Enkai (Social Gatherings)</h1>

<p>Enkai, or Japanese-style parties, are an essential part of Japanese work culture and serve as an opportunity for colleagues to socialize and build stronger relationships outside of the formal work environment. While everything is in Japanese at these events, do try to not isolate yourself. </p>

<p>At Lilyvale, several Enkai events are held throughout the year to celebrate various occasions:</p>

<p><strong>All-Lily Group Meeting Enkai</strong>: Following the All-Lily Group meeting, an Enkai is held as a way to foster camaraderie among the staff and create a sense of unity within the group. It is held at the same hotel as the meeting. The company in charge rotates; when it is Lilyvale's turn, you shouldn't have to do anything.</p>

<p><strong>New Teachers Enkai</strong>: At the beginning of the school year, an Enkai is organized to welcome new teachers to the Lilyvale community. It is held normally at the same hotel as the All-Lily meeting. This event provides an opportunity for new staff members to get acquainted with their colleagues in a relaxed atmosphere. Like the All-Lily, the dress is formal.</p>

<p><strong>担外 Group Enkai</strong>: The non-homeroom teacher group, which includes NLTs, participates in two Enkai events during the year. These gatherings allow members of this group to connect and bond over shared experiences and challenges. Unlike the others, which are fully paid for, the school will only pay up to a certain amount after which you will be required to pay. It normally ends up being 1500 to 2000 yen depending on the restaurant chosen. It typically isn't fine dining, so a more casual dress, including jeans, is fine.</p>

<p><strong>Farewell Enkai</strong>: Toward the end of the school year, an Enkai is held to bid farewell to teachers who are leaving Lilyvale. This event serves as a celebration of their contributions and a chance to wish them well in their future endeavors. Same as the one at the start of the year, at a hotel and in formal dress.</p>

<p>Participating in Enkai events is an excellent opportunity for you, as an NLT, to further integrate into the school community, develop closer relationships with your colleagues, and gain a deeper understanding of Japanese work culture. These events will have food, drink, and lively conversation, making them an enjoyable and enriching experience for all attendees. Also, while all but the All-Lily are not strictly mandatory, attending is highly recommended.
