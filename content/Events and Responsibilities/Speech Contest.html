<h1 class="text-center">Speech Contest</h1>
<hr>

<audio controls src=""></audio>

<p>The Speech Contest at Lilyvale Primary School consists of two main phases: the class contest and the whole school contest. Students from all grades participate, with different content for each grade level:</p>

<p>Grade 1: Teddy Bear or Cookie Jar Chant</p>

<p>Grade 2: Baa Baa Black Sheep</p>

<p>Grade 3: Miss Lucy</p>

<p>Grade 4: My Family (student-written speech)</p>

<p>Grade 5: Excerpts from the Gettysburg Address and JFK's Inaugural Address</p>

<p>Grade 6: My Dream (student-written speech)</p>

<p>Preparation for grades 1 to 3 and grade 5 mainly involves memorization.</p>

<h3>Your Role in Speech Contest Preparation</h3>

<p>Your primary responsibility will be to help students with pronunciation and intonation. For grades 4 and 6, you will also assist with writing, editing, and presentation skills for the student-written speeches. This process takes place over a couple of months. When editing, be careful not to remove the student's unique voice while keeping the speeches simple enough for parents who may not understand English.</p>

<h3>Class Contest</h3>

<p>During the class contest, you will record videos of students giving their speeches while grading them on accuracy, pronunciation, intonation, and presentation skills (eye contact, volume, gestures, etc.). After the class contest, you and the T1 teacher will decide which students advance to the whole school contest. The previous year's winner is considered special and can participate in the contest for a chance at a special award but is not eligible for the main award.</p>

<h3>Whole School Contest</h3>

<p>During the whole school contest, you will serve as a judge. Although the announcer may say that you will be judging only the grades you do not teach, you will actually have a vote on all grades. Please take notes on every contestant to ensure fair judgment.</p>
