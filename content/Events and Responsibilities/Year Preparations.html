<h1>Year Preparations</h1>

<p>At Lilyvale Primary School, there are two main preparations to make at the beginning of the year: taping the new textbook to the textbook set and creating the name labels for the incoming first graders.</p>

<h2>Taping the textbook:</h2>

<p>Gather the necessary materials: weak and strong double-sided tape. The weak tape can be found in the supply cabinet, while the strong tape belongs to the English Department and is usually stored in the bottom drawer of the staffroom bookshelf-cabinet.</p>

<p>Use the strong tape along the two long edges and the weak tape along the short edges of the new textbook. Make sure to tape the entire edge, as students like to pull things apart.</p>

<p>Carefully align the new textbook on top of the older book before pressing down. It's challenging to make corrections, so take your time with this step.</p>

<p>Inform Aoki-sensei if you need more strong tape, as ordering it can take a couple of weeks.</p>

<h2>Creating name labels for G1:</h2>

<p>Romanize the names of incoming first graders and input them into the flashcard program. The flashcard program is used to format the names on four lines like writing paper and in a font similar to what is taught. To print the names, click the pink button under the purple block labeled "WORD LIST" to select all names, then click the print button. Use the drop-down menu in the blue box to select the appropriate label size (18面 for large labels and 32面 for small). To edit the names, create a new entry in the flashcard program, then change the file extension of the saved file from ".tmgfc" to ".txt" and delete the old entry using Notepad. Note that you cannot delete or add letters to existing entries inside Notepad, as the entries depend on the character count. </p>

<p>Also, while the main program does not allow the creation of duplicates, it will work if you create the duplicate inside of notepad.</p>

<p>If you need to reinstall the flashcard program, ensure that the older .NET framework is downloaded in the Windows features if it isn't already installed.</p>
